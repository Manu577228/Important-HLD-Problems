1. Functional Requirements

*) User Registration and Authentication:
Users must be able to register with their phone number or email address and log in securely to manage their profile and purchase history.

*) Product Catalog:
The system should display categories of products (e.g., groceries, electronics, fashion). Products should include details like price, discounts, and availability.

*) Cart Management:
Users should be able to add/remove items from their shopping cart, modify quantities, and view their cart contents before checkout.

*) Order Placement:
Users should be able to place an order by selecting items, providing shipping details, and confirming the order.

*) Payment Integration:
Secure payment options must be integrated, such as credit/debit cards, wallets, and COD (Cash on Delivery).

*) Order Tracking:
Users should be able to track their order status (e.g., processing, shipped, delivered).

*) Shipping and Delivery:
Users should select a shipping address and delivery method. Orders should be dispatched from the nearest warehouse.

*) Promotions and Discounts:
Users should be able to apply promo codes or receive discounts based on offers or their loyalty status.

*) Reviews and Ratings:
Users can review products and rate the quality of service.

*) Wishlist:
Users can add items to a wishlist for later purchase.

2. Non-Functional Requirements

*) Scalability:
The platform must scale to handle large user bases during festivals or flash sales, employing horizontal scaling for databases and microservices.

*) Low Latency:
The response time for product searches, cart updates, and checkout should be minimal.

*) High Availability:
The system should guarantee 99.99% uptime, especially during sales events.

*) Security:
Sensitive data, including personal information and payment details, must be encrypted. Users should have secure logins via multi-factor authentication.

*) Global Availability:
The system should support multiple regions with localized currencies and product availability.

*) Data Integrity:
Ensure all transactional data is correctly captured and stored, especially in payment processing and order management.

3. Consistency / Availability

*) Consistency > Availability:
Consistency is crucial for transactions and order placement. Payment transactions need to be handled with strict consistency to prevent double payments. Order status updates can be eventually consistent.

4. APIs

*) User APIs:
1) /register: User registration with email/phone.
2) /login: User authentication and session management.
3) /profile: Retrieve and update user profile details.

*) Product Catalog APIs:
1) /getProducts: Fetch products based on category.
2) /getProductDetails: Fetch product details like price, availability, etc.
3) /searchProducts: Search for products based on name or description.

*) Cart APIs:
1) /addToCart: Add a product to the cart.
2) /removeFromCart: Remove a product from the cart.
3) /updateCart: Update the quantity of a product in the cart.

*) Order APIs:
1) /placeOrder: Place an order after confirming cart.
2) /getOrderStatus: Track the order status (e.g., processing, shipped, delivered).

Payment APIs:
1)/processPayment: Secure payment processing for orders.
2)/applyPromoCode: Apply a promotional code during checkout.

*) Shipping APIs:
1) /selectShippingMethod: Choose shipping method and delivery time.
2) /trackDelivery: Get real-time delivery status.

*) Review APIs:
1) /submitReview: Submit a review for a product or service.

5. Architecture

*) Microservices-Based Architecture:
Separate microservices for user management, product catalog, cart management, payment processing, shipping, and reviews.

*) Event-Driven Architecture:
Use Kafka or RabbitMQ to process events like order placement, payment verification, stock updates, and shipment status changes.

*) Payment Gateway Integration:
Integrate with third-party services like Stripe, Razorpay, or PayPal for secure payment transactions.

*) Load Balancer:
A load balancer to distribute traffic across web servers and prevent downtime.

*) Data Replication:
Use master-slave replication in databases to ensure high availability.

6. Data Flow

*) User Interaction:
A user logs in, browses the catalog, adds items to the cart, applies discounts, and proceeds to checkout.

*) Order Flow:
When the user places an order, the system processes payment, assigns a delivery method, and confirms the order.

*) Payment Flow:
The payment gateway processes the transaction, and once confirmed, the order is marked as paid.

*) Order Tracking Flow:
The order status is updated as it progresses through stages (e.g., processing, dispatched, delivered). Users can track it in real-time.

*) Delivery Flow:
The delivery system dispatches the order from the nearest warehouse, and the user can track the shipment until it's delivered.

7. Kind of Data Store

*) Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL):
Store user data, order records, payment details, product catalog, and reviews.

*) NoSQL Database (e.g., MongoDB):
Store dynamic data such as order status, cart data, and real-time updates.

*) Blob Storage (e.g., Amazon S3):
Store images, videos, and promotional media.

8. Scaling of DB

*) Horizontal Scaling:
Use database sharding to distribute user and order data across multiple database servers.

*) Replication:
Implement multi-region replication for availability and disaster recovery.

*) Partitioning:
Partition data by user region and product category for faster access and reduced latency.

9. Caching & Sharding

*) Caching:
Use Redis or Memcached for frequently accessed data such as popular products, user sessions, and recent orders.

*) Sharding:
Shard the order database by region and by order ID to optimize data access and reduce latency.

10. Failure & Fault Tolerance

*) Data Replication:
Replicate data across multiple servers to ensure availability even in case of server failures.

*) Retry Mechanisms:
Implement automatic retries for failed transactions, especially during payment processing.

*) Graceful Degradation:
Disable non-critical features (e.g., user reviews or wishlist) during system failures to keep core functionalities (e.g., product browsing, order placement) intact.

*) Fallback Strategies:
Use redundant systems and alternative APIs to ensure continuity of services during failure scenarios.

11. Logging & Security

*) Logging:
Use centralized logging systems like ELK Stack for real-time monitoring and analysis of operational metrics.

*) Security:
1) Implement HTTPS/TLS to encrypt user and transaction data.
2) Secure authentication using JWT tokens and OAuth2.0 for access control.
3) Regular security audits and penetration testing to ensure the system's security.
