1. Functional Requirements

*) User Registration and Authentication:
Users and drivers must register with their credentials (e.g., phone number, email) and authenticate during login.

*) Real-Time Ride Booking:
Users can request a ride by providing pick-up and drop-off locations.

*) Driver Matching:
Match riders with the nearest available driver based on location and availability.

*) Live Tracking:
Enable users to track their driver’s real-time location during the ride.

*) Pricing and Payment:
Dynamically calculate fares based on distance, time, and surge pricing, and process payments.

*) Ratings and Feedback:
Allow users and drivers to review and rate each other after a trip.

*) Trip History:
Maintain logs of completed trips for both users and drivers.

2. Non-Functional Requirements

*) Scalability:
Support millions of ride requests and GPS updates globally.

*) Low Latency:
Ensure minimal delays in matching drivers and updating locations.

*) High Availability:
Maintain 99.99% uptime with global coverage and redundancy.

*) Security:
Use encryption for sensitive data and secure communication channels.

*) Data Durability:
Ensure no data loss during failures through robust backup systems.

*) Reliability:
Guarantee successful processing of ride requests under high load.

*) User Experience:
Provide a seamless, responsive interface with real-time updates.

3. Consistency / Availability

*) Availability > Consistency:
Prioritize high availability while maintaining eventual consistency for ride updates and notifications.

4. APIs

*) User APIs:
1) /register: Register a user or driver with details.
2) /login: Authenticate user or driver credentials.

*) Ride APIs:

1) /bookRide: Submit a ride request.
2) /getRideStatus: Retrieve the status of an ongoing ride.
3) /completeRide: Mark a ride as completed.

*) Payment APIs:

1) /calculateFare: Calculate estimated fare.
2) /processPayment: Handle ride payment transactions.

*) Driver APIs:

1) /updateLocation: Update driver’s current GPS coordinates.
2) /setAvailability: Update driver’s availability status.

5. Architecture

*) Microservices Architecture:
Separate services for user management, ride-matching, location tracking, payments, and notifications.

*) Load Balancer:
Distribute incoming requests among servers.

*) Event-Driven Communication:
Use Kafka or RabbitMQ for real-time updates like ride status and GPS locations.

6. Data Flow

*) Ride Booking:
1) User sends a ride request.
2) Backend matches the user with the nearest available driver.
3) Notifications are sent to both the user and driver.

*) Ride Tracking:
GPS data from the driver is continuously updated and sent to the user.

*) Payment Processing:

Fare is calculated upon ride completion, and payment is processed.

7. Kind of Data Store

*) Relational Database (e.g., MySQL/PostgreSQL):
For user profiles, ride history, and payment transactions.

*) NoSQL Database (e.g., MongoDB/Cassandra):
For real-time ride data and driver availability.

*) Spatial Database (e.g., PostGIS):
For location-based queries like finding nearby drivers.

8. Scaling of DB

*) Horizontal Scaling:
Partition data based on geographic regions (e.g., city or country).

*) Replication:
Use master-slave replication for data redundancy and faster reads.

9. Caching & Sharding

*) Caching:
Use Redis or Memcached for frequently accessed data like user sessions and nearby drivers.

*) Sharding:
Shard databases based on user or ride IDs to balance the load.


10. Failure & Fault Tolerance

*) Replication:
Replicate data across multiple servers to prevent data loss.

*) Fallback Mechanism:
Retry failed requests using exponential backoff.

*) Circuit Breakers:
Isolate failing services to prevent cascading failures.

11. Logging & Security

*) Logging:
Use tools like ELK Stack for centralized logging and monitoring.

*) Security:
1) Encrypt all sensitive data at rest and in transit.
2) Use HTTPS and OAuth2 for secure communication and authentication.
3) Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration tests.
