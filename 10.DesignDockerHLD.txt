1. Functional Requirements

*) Containerization: Docker should allow users to package applications and their dependencies into containers, which can then be run consistently across different environments.

*) Image Creation: Users should be able to create Docker images for their applications, specifying a base image, required dependencies, and configuration settings.

*) Image Registry: Docker should provide a central registry for storing and distributing Docker images (e.g., Docker Hub or private registries).

*) Container Management: Users should be able to run containers from Docker images, start and stop them, and manage their lifecycle.

*) Networking: Docker should provide networking capabilities to allow containers to communicate with each other and the external world, including setting up virtual networks.

*) Volume Management: Docker should allow the mounting of volumes to persist data and share files between containers.

*) Orchestration: Docker should support orchestration tools (like Docker Compose or Kubernetes) to manage multi-container applications, including automatic scaling, failover, and load balancing.

2. Non-Functional Requirements

*) Scalability: Docker should support the creation of lightweight containers that can be deployed in large numbers for high scalability, especially in cloud-native environments.

*) Performance: Docker should ensure minimal overhead when running containers, with optimized CPU and memory usage.

*) High Availability: Docker should enable the deployment of containers with fault tolerance, ensuring high availability and resilience in production environments.

*) Security: Docker should ensure secure isolation between containers to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the integrity of data within containers.

*) Portability: Containers created using Docker should be portable across different environments, such as development, testing, and production, without any changes to the application code.

3. APIs

*) Docker Engine APIs:
1) /containers/create: Create a new container.
2) /containers/start: Start an existing container.
3) /containers/stop: Stop a running container.
4) /containers/exec: Execute commands in a running container.
5) /containers/remove: Remove a container.

*) Image APIs:
1) /images/create: Create an image from a Dockerfile.
2) /images/pull: Pull an image from a registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
3) /images/push: Push an image to a registry.
4) /images/remove: Remove a Docker image.

*) Volume APIs:
1) /volumes/create: Create a new volume for persistent data storage.
2) /volumes/remove: Remove an existing volume.

*) Network APIs:
1) /network/create: Create a new network for container communication.
2) /network/connect: Connect a container to a network.
3) /network/disconnect: Disconnect a container from a network.

4. Architecture

*) Client-Server Architecture: Docker follows a client-server architecture, where the client interacts with the Docker Engine API to manage containers, images, volumes, and networks.

*) Docker Engine: The Docker Engine is responsible for building, running, and managing Docker containers and images. It consists of several components, including a daemon (dockerd), a REST API, and a command-line interface (CLI).

*) Docker Daemon: The Docker Daemon (dockerd) is the background process that manages containers, images, networks, and volumes. It listens for Docker API requests and communicates with the operating system to manage resources.

*) Docker CLI: The Docker CLI is the command-line interface that users interact with to issue commands to the Docker Daemon. Users can build images, create containers, and perform other tasks through this CLI.

*) Docker Registry: A central repository where Docker images are stored. Docker Hub is the default public registry, but private registries can also be used for storing images.

5. Data Flow

*) Image Creation Flow:
1) User writes a Dockerfile that defines the image's configuration.
2)Docker Engine reads the Dockerfile and creates an image.
3) The image is stored in the local image repository or pushed to a Docker registry.

*) Container Management Flow:
1) The user creates a container from an image.
2) The container is started and begins running as an isolated process.
3) The user can execute commands in the container or stop it when needed.

*) Volume Management Flow:
1) A user creates a volume to persist data beyond the lifetime of a container.
2) The volume is mounted to a container, allowing it to store data that will persist even after the container is stopped or removed.

*) Network Flow:
1) The user creates a network to facilitate communication between containers.
2) Containers are connected to the network, allowing them to communicate securely with one another.

6. Data Stores

*) Docker Images: Docker images contain the application and all dependencies necessary to run it. They are typically stored in Docker registries (like Docker Hub).

*) Docker Volumes: Volumes are used to persist data beyond the lifecycle of a container. They can be stored on the host machine or in external storage systems.


7. Scaling of Containers

*) Horizontal Scaling: Docker supports horizontal scaling through orchestration tools like Docker Compose and Kubernetes, allowing multiple containers to run the same application across different machines or cloud environments.

*) Orchestration: Docker integrates with orchestration tools like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm to handle the management of multiple containers, ensuring that containers are automatically scaled and balanced according to traffic or workload demands.

8. Caching & Sharding

*) Caching: Docker images can be cached locally to avoid rebuilding them from scratch each time. Docker also caches layers during the build process to optimize build times.

*) Sharding: Sharding in Docker is typically handled at the application level or by the orchestration tool, allowing containers to be distributed across different nodes for better resource utilization and performance.

9. Failure & Fault Tolerance

*) Container Isolation: Docker ensures that containers run in isolated environments, preventing failures in one container from affecting others. If a container fails, it can be restarted or replaced without impacting the overall system.

*) Retry Mechanisms: Docker containers can be configured to restart automatically in case of failure, ensuring that services remain available in case of issues.

*) Graceful Degradation: In the case of failure in non-critical services (like logging or monitoring), the application can continue to function without disruption.

*) Fallback Mechanisms: Orchestration tools like Kubernetes can implement fallback strategies, ensuring that failed containers are replaced and traffic is routed to healthy instances.

10. Logging & Security

*) Logging: Docker logs are typically accessed using the Docker CLI or through centralized logging tools. The logs provide information about container activity, system errors, and application performance.

*) Security:

1) Container Isolation: Each container runs in its own isolated environment, preventing unauthorized access between containers.
2) User Permissions: Docker provides role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to Docker commands and resources.
3) Image Scanning: Docker provides image scanning features to detect vulnerabilities in container images.
4) Network Security: Docker allows the configuration of secure networking between containers, limiting exposure to the public network.
Monitoring.

*) Monitoring Tools: Use monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Docker's built-in stats to monitor the health and performance of containers, ensuring they are running as expected.

*) Alerts: Real-time alerts can be set up to notify administrators of critical issues like resource utilization limits, container failures, or service disruptions.
