1. Functional Requirements

*) User Management:
Allow users to register/login using their work email or Microsoft account.

*) Teams and Channels:
Create, join, and manage teams with nested channels for discussions.

*) Messaging:
Real-time one-on-one and group text messaging with rich media support.

*) File Sharing:
Allow users to upload, share, and manage files within teams and channels.

*) Video/Audio Calls:
Provide peer-to-peer and group audio/video conferencing with screen sharing and recording.

*) Scheduling:
Integrate with calendars to schedule and join meetings.

*) Collaborative Editing:
Enable real-time collaboration on documents using Microsoft Office integration.

2. Non-Functional Requirements

*) Scalability:
Support millions of concurrent users globally.

*) Low Latency:
Real-time updates for messaging, calls, and collaborative editing.

*) High Availability:
99.99% uptime with minimal maintenance downtime.

*) Security:
End-to-end encryption for messages, calls, and file sharing.

*) Cross-Platform Support:
Provide a seamless experience on desktop, web, and mobile.

*) Compliance:
Ensure compliance with industry regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC2.

3. Consistency / Availability

*) Consistency > Availability:
Focus on strong consistency for collaboration and file editing while using eventual consistency for messaging and notifications.

4. APIs
*) User APIs:
1) /register: Register a new user.
2) /login: Authenticate user credentials.

*)  Team and Channel APIs:
1) /createTeam: Create a new team.
2) /createChannel: Add a channel to an existing team.

*) Messaging APIs:
1) /sendMessage: Send a text or multimedia message.
2) /fetchMessages: Retrieve conversation history.

*) Call APIs:
1) /startCall: Initiate a voice or video call.
2) /endCall: Terminate an ongoing call.

*) File APIs:
1) /uploadFile: Upload a file to a team or channel.
2) /fetchFiles: Retrieve files for a team or channel.

5. Architecture

*) Microservices-Based Architecture:
Separate services for user management, messaging, calls, teams, and file management.

*) Load Balancer:
Distribute traffic evenly across multiple servers.

*) Event-Driven Communication:
Use message brokers like Kafka for real-time updates and notifications.

*) Media Server:
Deploy a scalable media server for audio/video calls and screen sharing.

6. Data Flow

*) User Interaction:
Users authenticate via the login API and interact with teams, channels, or messages.

*) Messaging:
Messages are sent to the server, queued, and delivered to recipients via WebSockets.

*) File Sharing:
Files are uploaded to the file service, stored in cloud storage, and shared via links.

*) Video/Audio Calls:
Calls are routed through the media server for connection and quality management.

7. Kind of Data Store

*) Relational Database (e.g., SQL Server):
Store user accounts, team metadata, and channel information.

*) NoSQL Database (e.g., DynamoDB):
Store messages and real-time data for scalability and low latency.

*) Blob Storage (e.g., Azure Blob Storage):
Store uploaded files and media content.

8. Scaling of DB

*) Horizontal Scaling:
Partition data by teams or channels to balance the load.

*) Replication:
Use master-slave replication for high availability and durability.

9. Caching & Sharding

*) Caching:
Use Redis for frequently accessed data like recent messages and active users.

*) Sharding:
Shard databases by user IDs or teams to distribute the data across multiple nodes.

10. Failure & Fault Tolerance

*) Data Replication:
Replicate data to multiple nodes to avoid single points of failure.

*) Graceful Degradation:
Disable non-critical features during high load to ensure core functionality remains operational.

*) Retry Mechanisms:
Automatically retry failed requests to mitigate transient failures.

11. Logging & Security

*) Logging:
Use centralized logging systems like Azure Monitor or ELK Stack to capture and analyze logs.

*) Security:
1) Encrypt all data in transit (TLS) and at rest (AES-256).
2) Secure APIs with OAuth2.0 and role-based access control (RBAC).
3) Conduct regular penetration tests and audits to identify vulnerabilities.
