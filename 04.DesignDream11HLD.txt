1. Functional Requirements

*) User Authentication and Profile:
Users must register/login to create and manage their fantasy team profiles.

*) Create and Join Contests:
Users can create custom contests or join pre-existing ones.

*) Team Formation:
Allow users to create fantasy teams by selecting players under a virtual budget.

*) Live Match Updates:
Provide real-time updates on player performances and match scores.

*) Leaderboard and Rankings:
Display rankings based on fantasy team performance in contests.

*) Prize Distribution:
Automate the calculation and distribution of prizes to winners after the contest ends.

2. Non-Functional Requirements

*) Scalability:
Handle millions of concurrent users, especially during popular matches.

*) Low Latency:
Provide real-time updates with minimal delay.

*) High Availability:
Ensure the platform is operational during critical match timings.

*) Security:
Safeguard user data and transactions using encryption and secure payment gateways.

*) Data Accuracy:
Ensure real-time data integrity for match updates and fantasy points calculation.

*) Compliance:
Adhere to legal and regulatory requirements for skill-based gaming in different regions.

3. Consistency / Availability

*) Availability > Consistency:
Ensure availability during high traffic events with eventual consistency for real-time updates and rankings.

4. APIs

*) User APIs:
1) /register: Register a new user.
2) /login: Authenticate users.

*) Contest APIs:
1) /createContest: Create a new contest.
2) /joinContest: Join an existing contest.

*) Team APIs:

1) /createTeam: Create a fantasy team.
2) /editTeam: Edit an existing team.

*) Live Update APIs:
1) /getLiveScores: Fetch real-time player and match stats.
2) /getLeaderboard: Fetch live contest rankings.

5. Architecture

*) Microservices Architecture:
Separate services for user management, contests, scoring, and payments.

*) Event-Driven Architecture:
Use message queues (e.g., Kafka) for handling live updates and scoring asynchronously.

*) Load Balancer:
Distribute incoming requests across multiple servers.

6. Data Flow

*) User Interaction:
Users log in and access contests or create fantasy teams.

*) Match Updates:
Real-time match data is ingested from third-party providers and processed by the scoring service.

*) Leaderboards and Rankings:
User scores are updated in near real-time and rankings are recalculated.

*) Prize Distribution:
After the contest ends, calculate winners and process prize payouts.

7. Kind of Data Store

*) Relational Database (e.g., MySQL/PostgreSQL):
Store user profiles, contest details, and transactions.

*) NoSQL Database (e.g., MongoDB/DynamoDB):
Store live match stats and scoring data for quick access.

*) Blob Storage (e.g., Amazon S3):
Store player images, contest banners, and other media.

8. Scaling of DB

*) Horizontal Scaling:
Partition contests or teams by contest ID or user ID to distribute the load.

*) Replication:
Use read replicas to handle high query traffic for leaderboard and stats access.

9. Caching & Sharding

*) Caching:
Use Redis or Memcached to cache frequently accessed data like live scores and rankings.

*) Sharding:
Use shard keys like contest IDs or user IDs to distribute data across database nodes.

10. Failure & Fault Tolerance

*) Replication:
Ensure data replication across multiple nodes to avoid single points of failure.

*) Fallback Mechanisms:
Serve cached scores and rankings during database outages.

*) Circuit Breakers:
Prevent cascading failures in microservices during high traffic.

11. Logging & Security

*) Logging:
Use centralized logging systems like ELK Stack for debugging and monitoring.

*) Security:
1) Encrypt sensitive user data at rest and in transit.
2) Secure APIs with OAuth2.0 and HTTPS.
3) Use fraud detection systems to monitor contest abuse or cheating.
