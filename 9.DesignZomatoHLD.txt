1. Functional Requirements

*) User Registration and Authentication: Users should be able to register using their phone number or email and log in to their accounts.

*) Restaurant Search: Users should be able to search for restaurants based on location, cuisine, and ratings.

*) Restaurant Menu: Each restaurant should have a dynamic menu with details about available dishes, prices, and nutritional information.

*) Order Placement: Users can select multiple dishes from the restaurant's menu, place the order, and provide delivery or pickup details.

*) Payment Integration: Secure payment methods (e.g., credit cards, wallets, cash on delivery) should be available to process the order payment.

*) Reviews and Ratings: Users should be able to leave reviews and rate restaurants and their dishes.

*) Order Tracking: Real-time tracking of order status from kitchen preparation to delivery.

*) Delivery Management: Assign delivery drivers based on proximity, availability, and load balancing.

*) Discounts and Promotions: Users should be able to apply promo codes and get discounts on their orders.

2. Non-Functional Requirements

*) Scalability: The system must support high volumes of concurrent users and requests, especially during peak meal times.

*) Low Latency: Ensure fast response times for searching restaurants, placing orders, and tracking deliveries.

*) High Availability: The system should be available 24/7 with 99.99% uptime, ensuring seamless food ordering at all times.

*) Security: User information, payment details, and order history should be encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.

*) Data Integrity: Ensure consistency in order status, payments, and inventory details, preventing any mismatches or errors.

*) Global Availability: Support for multiple countries with localized menus, currencies, and delivery options.

3. Consistency / Availability

*) Consistency > Availability: Prioritize consistency in transactions, ensuring reliable order placement and payment processes. Use eventual consistency for less critical features like order tracking and ratings.

4. APIs

*) User APIs:
1) /register: User registration using phone number or email.
2) /login: User authentication with phone/email.
3) /updateProfile: Update user profile information (address, contact).
4) /userOrders: Get the list of userâ€™s past orders.

*) Restaurant and Menu APIs:
1) /searchRestaurant: Search restaurants by location, cuisine, and ratings.
2) /getRestaurantMenu: Fetch restaurant's menu with details of dishes and prices.
3) /getRestaurantDetails: Get details of a specific restaurant (location, working hours, reviews).

*) Order APIs:
1) /placeOrder: Place a new order from a restaurant.
2) /updateOrder: Modify an order (add/remove items).
3) /trackOrder: Track the real-time status of an order.

*) Payment APIs:
1) /processPayment: Process the payment securely through various methods (card, wallet).
2) /applyPromoCode: Apply promo codes to get discounts.

*) Review APIs:
1) /submitReview: Submit a review for a restaurant or dish.
2) /getReviews: Fetch reviews for a specific restaurant or dish.

*) Delivery APIs:
/assignDelivery: Assign a delivery driver to an order.
/getDeliveryStatus: Get real-time updates on order delivery progress.

5. Architecture

*) Microservices-Based Architecture: The system should be designed using microservices to handle user management, order management, restaurant management, reviews, and payment processing.

*) Load Balancer: A load balancer should distribute traffic across multiple servers for increased availability.

*) Event-Driven Architecture: Use message queues (e.g., Kafka or RabbitMQ) to handle asynchronous events like order placement, payment processing, and delivery assignment.

*) Payment Gateway Integration: Third-party payment services like Stripe or Razorpay should be integrated for secure payment processing.

6.Data Flow

*) User Interaction: The user logs in, searches for restaurants, selects dishes from a menu, and places an order.

*) Order Flow: After the user places an order, the system stores order details, processes payment, and assigns a delivery driver. Users can track their order in real-time.

*) Payment Flow: The payment system interacts with third-party payment processors (e.g., Stripe) to securely process payments for orders.

*) Order Tracking Flow: The order's status is updated in real-time, allowing users to track the order from preparation to delivery.

*) Delivery Flow: Once the order is ready, the system assigns a nearby delivery driver. The delivery status is updated as the driver moves toward the delivery destination.

7.Data Stores

*) Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL): Store structured data, including user profiles, order details, restaurant menus, and reviews.

*) NoSQL Database (e.g., MongoDB): Store real-time data, such as order tracking information and other dynamic content.

*) Blob Storage (e.g., Amazon S3): Store promotional images, restaurant logos, and other media assets.

8. Scaling of DB

*) Horizontal Scaling: Distribute user, restaurant, and order data across multiple database nodes using sharding.

*) Replication: Use master-slave replication to ensure high availability and data fault tolerance.

*) Partitioning: Partition user and order data based on geographical regions or user IDs to improve performance.

9.Caching & Sharding

*) Caching: Use Redis or Memcached for caching frequently accessed data, such as popular restaurant menus, user sessions, and restaurant details.

*) Sharding: Implement sharding to divide order data by region or order IDs to optimize database performance.

10. Failure & Fault Tolerance

*) Data Replication: Replicate all essential data (orders, user profiles, reviews) to avoid data loss in the event of server failure.

*) Retry Mechanisms: Ensure automatic retries for failed operations, especially during payment processing.

*) Graceful Degradation: Non-critical features like reviews or menus should be disabled during failures to prioritize core functionalities (order placement, payment, delivery).

*) Fallback Mechanisms: Implement fallback strategies using secondary servers or APIs to ensure uninterrupted service.

11. Logging & Security

*) Logging: Implement centralized logging for all events (user actions, orders, payments, etc.) using tools like ELK Stack or CloudWatch.

*) Security:
1) Encrypt sensitive user and payment data using HTTPS/TLS.
2) Implement secure user authentication with JWT tokens and OAuth 2.0.
3) Periodically audit the system for vulnerabilities and ensure PCI-DSS compliance for payment handling.

12. System Monitoring

*) Monitoring Tools: Use monitoring tools like Prometheus or New Relic to track application performance, identify bottlenecks, and alert administrators in case of failures.
*) Alerts: Set up real-time alerts for critical system failures, high traffic spikes, or unusual payment behavior.
